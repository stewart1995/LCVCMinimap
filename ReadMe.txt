LCVC Minimap (Tebex $15): https://wraithtechgaming.tebex.io/package/5916632

This map has a script compatible for all FiveM servers, ensure any existing addons are not disabling minimap and delete any existing .ytd and .ydd files in your database's folder. You can replace the .ytd and .ydd files in the respective directories of your current database folder or use the script by renaming the scripts folder to "LCVC Minimap" and placing the stream folder into the LCVC Minimap folder then add "ensure LCVC Minimap" to your server.cfg. LS map is removed. LC is centered, VC is in a South Western direction within Codewalker's map border. The Vice City minimap is coordinated according to the version of the Vice City map I'm using that I moved within Codewalker's map border. You may need to use a ybn & ymap mover : https://www.gta5-mods.com/tools/ymap-ybn-mover to move your FiveM Vice City map to the correct spot. You can use a version of Liberty City that excludes LS and is centered or include a script in your database folder with your Vice City map that removes LS. After moving your Vice City map, restore the mall, club, stripclub, bank, and hotel .ybn's from the original download to your new map directory.
